SEO: Optimize with meta titles, descriptions, and schema markup (e.g., HowTo for guides). Aim for 2-3 internal links per post to forum or store.
Distribution: Share on Reddit (r/AutoDetailing), Instagram (reels, stories), TikTok (short clips), and Twitter (threads). Email subscribers with weekly digests.
Metrics to Track:

Traffic: Blog views, bounce rate, time on page (Google Analytics).
Engagement: Forum sign-ups, comments, shares (Mixpanel).
Conversions: Store clicks, email sign-ups, sales attributed to content (Stripe, SendGrid).
