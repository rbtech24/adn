2. Tech Stack Details
A fully custom system requires a robust, scalable tech stack optimized for real-time community interactions, e-commerce, and content delivery. Below is a detailed breakdown:

Backend:

Framework: Node.js + Express for a lightweight, real-time API supporting forum notifications and store transactions. Alternatively, Django + FastAPI (Python) for rapid development and strong security.
Database:
PostgreSQL: For structured data (users, posts, orders) with strong relational capabilities.
MongoDB: For flexible product data (e.g., varying attributes for waxes vs. tools) and content metadata.
Redis: For caching (e.g., forum threads) and session management to boost performance.
Search: Elasticsearch for fast, full-text search across forum posts, products, and blog articles.
Authentication: OAuth 2.0 with Auth0 for secure user logins (Google, Facebook, email) and role-based access (e.g., admin, moderator).
Frontend:

Framework: React + Next.js for a dynamic, SEO-friendly UI with server-side rendering for blog and store pages.
Styling: Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive design with a sleek, car-inspired aesthetic (e.g., glossy black and chrome accents).
State Management: Redux or Zustand for managing complex user interactions (e.g., forum replies, cart updates).
Media Handling: Cloudinary for optimized image/video uploads (e.g., user-submitted car photos).
Infrastructure:

Cloud Provider: AWS (EC2 for servers, S3 for storage, RDS for PostgreSQL) with Elastic Beanstalk for easy deployment.
CDN: Cloudflare for fast content delivery, DDoS protection, and DNS management.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
Monitoring: Sentry for error tracking and New Relic for performance monitoring.
Integrations:

Payments: Stripe for secure checkout, subscriptions, and split payments (for future marketplace features).
Email: SendGrid for transactional emails (e.g., order confirmations) and newsletters.
Analytics: Mixpanel for user behavior tracking (e.g., which forum topics drive store clicks) and Google Analytics for traffic.
APIs: Custom APIs for supplier integrations (e.g., dropshipping) and social media (e.g., Instagram feed for user photos).
Development Tools:

Version Control: Git with GitHub for collaboration.
Testing: Jest (unit tests), Cypress (end-to-end), and Postman for API testing.
IDE: VS Code with extensions for TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.
Security:

HTTPS: Enforce with Letâ€™s Encrypt.
Data Protection: GDPR/CCPA-compliant user data handling with encrypted storage.
Rate Limiting: NGINX to prevent API abuse.
Penetration Testing: Conduct pre-launch with tools like OWASP ZAP.
